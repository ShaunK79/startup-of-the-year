# Startup-Of-The-Year-landing page

This is a landing page project I completed whilst on the ZeroToMastery course where I learnt some of the following:

* Bootstrap - what bootstrap is, how to use it, how to copy links and place them in your index.html e.g - responsive meta tag
* html - created a boilerplate with the neccesary meta tags (charset UTF-8, responsive bootstrap) links ( bootstrap, stylesheet), body, image (background url), header, h1, anchor tag ( mailchimp link )
* CSS - styling of the page, used CSS-tricks for the background image
* Mailing list - how to set up a mailing list using mailchimp
